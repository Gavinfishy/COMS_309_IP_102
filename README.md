# COMS_309_IP_102
This is the group project created in the class COMS 309. I worked on the backend with one other member.

The idea of the project was to make a workout application for teams. Coaches can make a "team" which athletes could join. Coaches could assign workouts to individual team members or assign to the entire team.
There are also gymrats which track their own workouts.

This was a great project to teach me how to use GIT, understand how front end and backend work together, and how to plan and work with a team.
